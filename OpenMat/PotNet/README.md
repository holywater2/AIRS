## Running Summation Algorithm

To run the summation algorithm, please run below commands in order to install the algorithm package

```shell
cd functions
tar xzvf gsl-latest.tar.gz
cd gsl-2.7.1
./configure --prefix=$CONDA_PREFIX
make
make install
```

Then edit `~/.bashrc` by adding

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/
```

Now we back to `functions` directory and run

```shell
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

Then the algorithm is installed as Cython package. A simple way to test if it is successfully installed is to run below in the root directory.

```shell
python test_algorithm.py
```



## Acknowledgement

The underlying training part is based on [ALIGNN](https://github.com/usnistgov/alignn) [2] and the incomplete Bessel Function is based on [ScaFaCoS](https://github.com/scafacos/scafacos) [3].
